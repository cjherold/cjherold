### About
* I'm working on posting more projects to Github instead of just hording them all to myself locally. I will most likely start the projects as private and then switch them to public once they are finished.

*** 

### Coming Soon
* typescript-starter
  * I'm working on a starter for static web pages that uses typescript, handlebars, gulp, webpack, babel, and a number of other things. This will make it very convenient to create simple web pages that get compiled and minimized into a dist folder.

***

### Interests
* I am focused mainly on web development at the moment. I also have interests in raspberry pi projects, python, machine learning, pc building and more. There just isn't enough time in the day.
